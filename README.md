# Asynchronous-Echo-Server
This code creates a simple TCP echo server that listens on localhost port 8888. When a client connects, it reads up to 100 bytes of data from the client, decodes it from bytes to a string, prints it to the console, sends the data back to the client, and then closes the connection.
